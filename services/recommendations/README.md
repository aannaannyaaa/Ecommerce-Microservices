# Recommendation Service

The **Recommendation Service** is responsible for processing user orders and generating personalized product recommendations based on purchase history. It uses a scheduled job to process orders daily and maintains user purchase patterns for improved recommendation accuracy.

## Features

### **Core Functionality**
- **Daily Order Processing**: Automatically processes all orders at midnight UTC
- **Purchase History Tracking**: Maintains detailed user purchase history in Redis
- **Smart Recommendations**: Generates personalized product recommendations based on:
  - User purchase patterns
  - Category preferences
  - Product availability
  - Purchase recency

### **Service Integration**
- Communicates with the **Orders Service** and **Products Service** via HTTP
- **Kafka-based event publishing** for recommendation events
- **Redis caching** for user purchase history and order data

### **Monitoring and Observability**
- **Prometheus-compatible metrics** exposed at **`http://localhost:9205/metrics`**
- Comprehensive metrics tracking:
  - Order processing duration
  - Recommendations generated
  - Processing errors
  - Service connection status
  - System metrics (CPU, memory, etc.)

### **Kafka Integration**
- Publishes to:
  - `recommendation-events` : Product recommendations for user notification processing

## API Endpoints


### **GET /metrics**

- **Description**: Prometheus metrics endpoint
- **Response**: Prometheus-formatted metrics

### **POST /process**
- **Description**: Manually triggers order processing and recommendation generation
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success"
  }
  ```

## Workflow

* `index.ts`: Initializes the service, sets up Redis connection.
* `scheduler.ts` : Manages a daily cron job for order processing.
* `OrderProcessor`: Processes incoming orders by storing order data in Redis, updating user purchase history, and fetching detailed product information from the Products service via REST APIs requests.
* `RecommendationProcessor`: Generates product recommendations by analyzing user purchase history from Redis, identifying preferred product categories, fetching relevant products from the Products service, publishing recommendations to the `recommendation-events` Kafka topic, and falling back to default recommendations when necessary.

### Algorithm : 

1. The recommendation algorithm analyzes a user's purchase history to identify their most frequently purchased product categories, then attempts to recommend in-stock products from these categories that the user hasn't previously purchased. 
2. If no suitable products are found in the user's preferred categories, the system falls back to recommendations from the default Electronics category. If that also fails, it uses a predefined set of default products. 
3. For users with no purchase history, the system directly serves recommendations from the Electronics category, ensuring every user receives at least three product recommendations. All recommendations are filtered to include only in-stock items and are published to a Kafka topic for further processing.

## Running the Product Service Locally

Ensure that all dependent services (e.g., MongoDB, Kafka, Redis) are up and running before starting the product service. Use the following commands to start the service:

```bash
cp .env.example .env 
yarn install
yarn start
```

The Product API will be accessible at **`http://localhost:8005`**.

For deployment, use **Docker Compose** to start the service with the necessary dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
